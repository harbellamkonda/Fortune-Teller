# fortune-teller
I created a fortune teller. First, the user is prompted to enter a number, and then fortune is outputed.

I added a couple of tweaks which allow users to request for more fortunes and a GUI to allow for better user interaction.

I used two tutorials to help me complete the fortune teller. The tutorial links are:
